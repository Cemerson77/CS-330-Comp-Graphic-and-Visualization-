## How do I approach designing software?
Defining the problem you're trying to solve when approaching software design is essential. Understand the requirements, user needs, and constraints. Plan the software's overall structure, breaking it into modules or components. Design these components to be modular, reusable, and loosely coupled. Use design patterns and principles like SOLID to ensure flexibility and maintainability. Create diagrams, flowcharts, or mockups to visualize the architecture and user interactions. Continuously iterate on the design as you gather feedback and uncover edge cases. Keep user experience and performance in mind throughout the process.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on this project has enhanced my skills in modular design, encapsulation, and separation of concerns. I've learned to create flexible and extensible systems by breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable components. I've gained experience designing APIs that abstract low-level details and enable users to work at a higher level of abstraction. Additionally, I've honed my ability to plan and organize a project's architecture and design in a way that promotes maintainability and scalability.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?
For my project work, I followed a systematic design process. I started by analyzing the requirements and visualizing the end product. I then identified the key components needed and their relationships. Next, I designed the interfaces for each component and determined how they would interact. I used UML diagrams and pseudocode to illustrate the architecture. After implementing a basic structure, I iteratively refined the design, incorporating professor feedback and making adjustments as necessary.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The design approach used in this project can be applied in future work by focusing on modularization, encapsulation, and iterative development. By breaking down complex projects into smaller, well-defined components, future projects can be more manageable and easier to maintain. Encapsulation ensures that each component has a clear and well-defined interface, promoting reusability. Iterative development allows for continuous improvement and adaptability based on user feedback.

## How do I approach developing programs?
Developing programs involves several key steps. First, understand the problem domain and requirements thoroughly. Plan the program's structure, breaking it down into functions, classes, or modules. Write clear and organized code, following coding standards and best practices. Test your code rigorously to ensure correctness and catch errors early. Use version control to track changes and collaborate with others. Document your code and consider performance optimization as needed. Iterate and refine based on testing results and feedback.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
While working on the 3D scene, I employed strategies such as modularization, object-oriented programming, and separating concerns. I designed each shape as a separate class, encapsulating their geometry, transformations, and rendering logic. This modular approach made managing and extending the scene's components easier. I also leveraged a version control system to track changes and collaborated effectively with others, especially when refining the design and resolving issues.

## How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration played a significant role in my development process. As I implemented different components of the scene, I iteratively refined their implementations based on testing and feedback. This allowed me to catch bugs early, make improvements, and adapt the design to changing requirements. Iteration also enabled me to gradually build up the scene, focusing on one object at a time, which helped manage complexity and ensure each part was functioning correctly before moving on.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project's completion?
My approach to developing code has become more organized, modular, and systematic throughout the milestones leading to the project's completion. Initially, I focused on getting the basic functionality working. As I progressed, I focused on improving code structure and design. I increasingly emphasized modularity and reusability by creating separate classes for different shapes and using inheritance to manage common properties. I also became more conscious of encapsulation, ensuring each class had a clear purpose and well-defined interface.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science offers a fundamental toolkit that is invaluable for aspiring software engineers. It provides you with essential problem-solving skills, the ability to think algorithmically, and the expertise to design efficient and scalable solutions. As a software engineer, you will leverage computational techniques to analyze complex data, enabling you to make informed decisions and automate intricate processes. Moreover, computer science nurtures a mindset of perpetual learning and adaptability, critical attributes in the ever-evolving landscape of technology. By mastering computer science principles, you'll be well-equipped to excel in your journey toward becoming a skilled and accomplished software engineer.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations provide insights into representing and manipulating visual data. By working on 3D scenes, you learn about geometry, rendering, and visual aesthetics. These skills can be applied in various educational pathways, such as data science, where you can visualize complex data sets to communicate insights effectively. In engineering or architecture, you can use visualization techniques to model and simulate real-world scenarios.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations offer practical skills that are highly sought after in many professions. In fields like game development, simulation, and virtual reality, you'll apply these skills to create immersive experiences. In data analysis and business intelligence, you can use visualizations to present patterns and trends in data. Transforming abstract data into compelling visual representations is a valuable asset in various professional domains.
